# 16. Write a program to input two integers. Call the first x and the second y.
# You program should calculate the quotient and remainder when x is
# divided by y
x=int(input("Please enter integer X:"))
y=int(input("Please enter integer Y:"))
print("When X is divided by y")
q=x//y
r=x%y
print("Thier quotient is:",q)
print("Thier remainder is:",r)
