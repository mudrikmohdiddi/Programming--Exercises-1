# 5. Distance Traveled
# Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels 
# down the interstate can be calculated with the following formula:
# Distance = Speed * Time
# A car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the 
# following:
# • The distance the car will travel in 5 hours
# • The distance the car will travel in 8 hours
# • The distance the car will travel in 12 hours
print("The distance that car travel when speed is 60 miles per hour")
d1=60*5
d2=60*8
d3=60*12
print("The distance the car will travel in 5 hours is:",d1)
print("The distance the car will travel in 8 hours is:",d2)
